As they become more scarce, our world will slowly grind to a halt; we simply cannot function without them. Drawing on the latest ground-breaking research and a lifetime's study, Dave Goulson reveals the shocking decline of insect populations that has taken place in recent decades, with potentially catastrophic consequences. He passionately argues that we must all learn to love, respect and care for our six-legged friends.", "category": 6, "image_url": "https://lrb-bookshop-production.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/lrb_bookshop/1200_filter/images/3/8/2/9/2029283-1-eng-GB/9781787333345.jpg", "image": "goulson_silent-earth.jpg"}},

A Londoner for over twenty years, moving from flat to Tube to air-conditioned office, Melissa Harrison knew what it was to be insulated from the seasons. Adopting a dog and going on daily walks helped reconnect her with the cycle of the year and the quiet richness of nature all around her: swifts nesting in a nearby church; ivy-leaved toadflax growing out of brick walls; the first blackbird's song; an exhilarating glimpse of a hobby over Tooting Common. Moving from scrappy city verges to ancient, rural Suffolk, where Harrison eventually relocates, this diary - compiled from her beloved Nature Notebook column in The Times - maps her joyful engagement with the natural world and demonstrates how we must first learn to see, and then act to preserve, the beauty we have on our doorsteps - no matter where we live.", "category": 6, "image_url": "https://lrb-bookshop-production.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/lrb_bookshop/1200_filter/images/8/3/9/3/1953938-2-eng-GB/9780571363513.jpg", "image": "harrison_stubborn-light-things.jpg"}},

Einstein's Fridge tells the story of how scientists uncovered the least known and yet most consequential of all the sciences, and learned to harness the power of heat and ice. The laws of thermodynamics govern everything from the behaviour of atoms to that of living cells, from the engines that power our world to the black hole at the centre of our galaxy. Not only that, but thermodynamics explains why we must eat and breathe, how the lights come on, and ultimately how the universe will end. The people who decoded its laws came from every branch of the sciences - they were engineers, physicists, chemists, biologists, cosmologists and mathematicians. Their discoveries, set over two hundred years, kick-started the industrial revolution, changed the course of world wars and informed modern understanding of black holes. This book captures the thrill of discovery and the power of revolutionary science to change the world forever.", "category": 6, "image_url": "https://lrb-bookshop-production.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/lrb_bookshop/1200_filter/images/3/4/2/8/1968243-2-eng-GB/9780008262792.jpg", "image": "sen_einsteins-fridge.jpg"}},
